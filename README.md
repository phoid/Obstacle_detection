### To Run Daniel's thing:
python create_database.py [las file] [xml file]

### Currently, to produce a LAS file, this project used MicMac. Installation is found on the site (linked below)
https://micmac.ensg.eu/index.php/Install_MicMac_Windows

As long as your 3d object is LAS, it should run. So any software that can do that will suffice

### Linked a locally hosted database. We realize this is locally hosted, but we included this as proof of concept and also easy way to set up a database for the algorithm. Be sure to install Python Flask
