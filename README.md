### To Run Daniel's thing:
python create_database.py [las file] [xml file]

### Currently, to produce a LAS file, this project used MicMac. Installation is found on the site (linked below)
https://micmac.ensg.eu/index.php/Install_MicMac_Windows

As long as your 3d object is LAS, it should run. So any software that can do that will suffice

### To run server:
python server.py in CMD/Terminal
Running Daniel's algorithm will send to the database, which is hosted on Alex's computer
